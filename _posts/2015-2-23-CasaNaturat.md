#Casa Natura

<p>  Everyone wants to live in a healthy home. Casa Natura provides friendly cleaning and personal product that are
made with natural and non-toxic ingredients. One of the products I tested out was the Mamaâ€™s Windows Streak Free glass 
cleaner. This product is a replacement of windex. Witch has a harsh smell when spraying and bad toxic chemicals.
Today we have a lot of cleaning product in our home that have lots of toxic chemical that can affect you or
your love one by using them. This cleaning product we use every day might clean our surface of our home, 
but can cause cancer or some other disease in the long run. This why a lot of companies like Casa Natura are make organic product, because of all the harsh chemicals that are being used in our products.
