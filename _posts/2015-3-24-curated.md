####Apple Watch Vs Android

<p>However, these two bands are both excellent watches , but it depends on witch one is right for your device. 
Both smart watches come in variety of shape, sizes and designs. 
but, what I love about the apple iWatch product it has "Retina" colorful OLED resolution screen  and also come with "Force Touch" the flexible screen can sense differences between light and presses that solves complex commands. The batter life is 18 hours and you can pick up the phone while your hand down. 

<p>Android high resolution display comes with e-paper screen black and white. It also has a great search engine that you can swipe easy with your fingers to go to the next page. with a camera on top to take a picture of yourself.  Batter last 24 hours. That's great you don't have to continue regarding.
