![Dress](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150226215539-black-blue-dress-super-169.jpg)



<p>It’s crazy how people view this dress a different color then what its regular color.  All over the over the world people argue is this dress really blue and black or gold and white?  I did believe it at first until someone showed me the picture and I tested it out on my family member and friends. Everyone in my house said it was black and blue, but my nephew who is 8 saw the dress gold and white and my two friends I showed. They thought I was crazy and did not know my color. We were going back in forth on the color that I had to show them proof of the color scheme. My sister thought her son was color blind and he needed to see the doctor. I told her it’s okay, not only he that sees this dress as gold and white. 
<p>I was so shock how people saw this dress a different color then me is started to do research on the dress. Why do the eyes see different color on this Black and blue dress.
