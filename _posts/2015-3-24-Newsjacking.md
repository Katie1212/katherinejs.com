![gaga](http://ll-media.tmz.com/2012/05/13/0513-lady-gaga-ring-2.jpg)

###Lady Gaga confirmed her engagement on her Instagram 
She posted a picture of her engagement ring, but didn’t say who it was. 
February 16, she shared pictures of a heart shape ring and said, “ He gave me his heart on Valentine's Day, and I said YES!"
World shocker!!! Who’s the guy to give his heart away???
Taylor Kinner an actor who has been on a couple of shows like Trauma, The Vampire Diaries, and Shameless. 
Good-looking guy.  They met on set of Gaga's song “You and I”, witch was shot in Nebraska the day she wore her mother actual wedding gown. Luck dress got her a man. These two have been inseparable since there brake up in 2012.  Wish these two the best.
